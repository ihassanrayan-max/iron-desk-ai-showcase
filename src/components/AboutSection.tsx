                We're building IronDeskAI to solve a simple problem: service businesses 
                need automation, but most tools are either too complex or too generic. 
                We're taking a different approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based in the GTA, we're focused on creating lightweight AI workflows 
                that actually ship. No bloated features, no endless customizationâ€”just 
                practical automation that works for real businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have our first client in trial and we're iterating fast. This 
                front-end is live, features are rolling out, and we're building 
                everything transparently.
              </p>
